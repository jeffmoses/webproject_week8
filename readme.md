### Interactive Portfolio Website

-----

### Project Overview

This project is an interactive portfolio website built exclusively with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and dynamic platform to showcase my skills and projects without relying on frameworks or external libraries. This approach allows for a deep understanding of core web technologies and provides complete control over the design and functionality.

### Key Features

  * **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, using CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
  * **Smooth Scrolling:** A custom JavaScript function provides smooth, animated scrolling when navigating between sections.
  * **Interactive Navigation:** A responsive hamburger menu for mobile devices is implemented with JavaScript, enhancing the user experience on smaller screens.
  * **Project Showcase:** A dedicated section highlights projects with interactive hover effects and detailed descriptions.
  * **Contact Form:** A simple, non-functional contact form (to be integrated with a backend service later) demonstrates form structure and design.

-----

### Technologies Used

  * **HTML5:** The semantic structure of the website.
  * **CSS3:** For all styling, including layout, typography, colors, and animations.
  * **JavaScript:** To add interactivity, handle events, and create dynamic effects.
